# Design Spreadsheet
A spreadsheet is a grid with 26 columns (labeled from 'A' to 'Z') and a given number of rows. Each cell in the spreadsheet can hold an integer value between 0 and 105.

Implement the Spreadsheet class:
- `Spreadsheet(int rows)` Initializes a spreadsheet with 26 columns (labeled 'A' to 'Z') and the specified number of rows. All cells are initially set to 0.
- `void setCell(String cell, int value)` Sets the value of the specified cell. The cell reference is provided in the format "AX" (e.g., "A1", "B10"), where the letter represents the column (from 'A' to 'Z') and the number represents a 1-indexed row.
- `void resetCell(String cell)` Resets the specified cell to 0.
- `int getValue(String formula)` Evaluates a formula of the form "=X+Y", where X and Y are either cell references or non-negative integers, and returns the computed sum.

Note: If getValue references a cell that has not been explicitly set using setCell, its value is considered 0.

Example 1:
Input:
["Spreadsheet", "getValue", "setCell", "getValue", "setCell", "getValue", "resetCell", "getValue"]
[[3], ["=5+7"], ["A1", 10], ["=A1+6"], ["B2", 15], ["=A1+B2"], ["A1"], ["=A1+B2"]]
Output:
[null, 12, null, 16, null, 25, null, 15]

Explanation
- `Spreadsheet spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet(3);` // Initializes a spreadsheet with 3 rows and 26 columns
- `spreadsheet.getValue("=5+7");` // returns 12 (5+7)
- `spreadsheet.setCell("A1", 10);` // sets A1 to 10
- `spreadsheet.getValue("=A1+6");` // returns 16 (10+6)
- `spreadsheet.setCell("B2", 15);` // sets B2 to 15
- `spreadsheet.getValue("=A1+B2");` // returns 25 (10+15)
- `spreadsheet.resetCell("A1");` // resets A1 to 0
- `spreadsheet.getValue("=A1+B2");` // returns 15 (0+15)
 

Constraints:
- 1 <= rows <= 10^3
- 0 <= value <= 10^5
- The formula is always in the format "=X+Y", where X and Y are either valid cell references or non-negative integers with values less than or equal to 10^5.
- Each cell reference consists of a capital letter from 'A' to 'Z' followed by a row number between 1 and rows.
- At most 10^4 calls will be made in total to setCell, resetCell, and getValue.

# Solution Breakdown & Deepdive
Break down and deep-dive into the provided **Spreadsheet** class solution, exploring it through the lens of core computer science concepts, algorithms, software engineering principles, best practices, and design patterns.

## 1. **Computer Science Concepts**

### a. **Data Structures**
- **Dictionary (Hash Map):**  
  The solution uses a Python dictionary, `self.data`, to store only explicitly set cell values.  
  - **Why?**  
    - **Sparsity:** Most cells are zero (default), so storing all cells (as in a 2D array) would waste space.
    - **Efficiency:** Lookups, inserts, and deletions in a dict are average O(1) time.
  - **Key Structure:** Tuple `(row, col)` is used as the key, allowing direct access to any cell.

### b. **String Parsing**
- **Cell Reference Parsing:**  
  Cell references like `"A1"` are parsed into a column index (`ord(cell[0]) - ord('A')`) and row index (`int(cell[1:]) - 1`).
- **Formula Parsing:**  
  Formulas are simple strings like `=X+Y`, split using `split('+')` and checked for integer vs. cell reference.

### c. **Zero-Default Convention**
- Unset cells are considered to have a value of 0—this is implemented via `dict.get(key, 0)`.

## 2. **Algorithms**

### a. **Formula Evaluation**
- **Operand Extraction:**  
  Each operand in the formula can be a number or a cell reference.
- **Evaluation Logic:**  
  - If operand is a number: Convert and use.
  - If operand is a cell: Lookup in `self.data`.

### b. **No Recursion or Chained References**
- The problem scope does not include chained formulas (e.g., `=A1+B2` where `A1` itself is `=B2+5`), so the algorithm is straightforward.

## 3. **Principles & Practices**

### a. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Parsing** and **Value Retrieval** are separated:
  - `parse_cell` isolates cell reference logic.
  - `get_cell_value` handles fetching values.
  - `getValue` handles formula evaluation.

### b. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each method does one thing:
  - `setCell`: Set a value.
  - `resetCell`: Remove/reset a value.
  - `getValue`: Compute a formula.

### c. **Sparse Storage Optimization**
- Only store nonzero values, minimizing memory usage—a classic optimization for sparse matrices.

### d. **Graceful Handling of Missing Data**
- Unset cells default to zero, avoiding KeyError and matching spreadsheet expectations.

### e. **Stateless Formula Evaluation**
- No state is changed during evaluation; formulas are read-only and idempotent.

## 4. **Best Practices**

### a. **Input Validation**
- Assumes valid input (per problem statement), but real-world code would validate cell references and row/column bounds.

### b. **Encapsulation**
- All spreadsheet data and logic are encapsulated in the class, exposing only the required interface.

### c. **Readability**
- Helper methods like `parse_cell` and `get_cell_value` improve readability and maintainability.

## 5. **Patterns**

### a. **Flyweight Pattern (Implicit)**
- The sparse storage approach mimics the **Flyweight** pattern:  
  - Only nonzero cells have explicit storage; all others implicitly share the default value (zero).

### b. **Command Pattern (Interface Design)**
- The class acts as a **Command Invoker**: external calls (`setCell`, `resetCell`, `getValue`) change or query the state.

## 6. **Extensibility Considerations**

- With this design, extending to support more complex formulas or cell dependencies (e.g., `=A1+B1*C2`) would require:
  - A formula parser (Lexer/Parser).
  - Dependency tracking for update propagation (observer pattern, or cell dependency graph).

## 7. **Efficiency**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - `setCell`, `resetCell`, `get_cell_value`: O(1)
  - `getValue`: O(1) for current formula format (could be more for complex formulas)
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - Proportional to the number of explicitly set cells, not the entire grid.

## 8. **Summary Table**

| Aspect                 | Approach                        | Reason/Benefit                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Storage                | Dict with (row, col) keys       | Sparse, efficient             |
| Parsing                | String parsing                  | Simplicity, flexibility       |
| Default value handling | dict.get(key, 0)                | Graceful, avoids KeyError     |
| API Design             | set/reset/getValue methods      | Clean, single responsibility  |
| Optimization           | Only store nonzero cells        | Memory-efficient              |

**In summary:**  
The solution uses efficient sparse storage, simple parsing, and direct mapping of spreadsheet logic to code. It leverages hash maps for O(1) access and modularizes parsing and evaluation concerns, following best practices in object-oriented and data structure design. The approach is scalable, readable, and extensible for the problem’s constraints.
