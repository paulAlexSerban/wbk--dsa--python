# Design Task Manager
There is a task management system that allows users to manage their tasks, each associated with a priority. The system should efficiently handle adding, modifying, executing, and removing tasks.

Implement the TaskManager class:
-` TaskManager(vector<vector<int>>& tasks)` initializes the task manager with a list of user-task-priority triples. Each element in the input list is of the form `[userId, taskId, priority]`, which adds a task to the specified user with the given priority.
- `void add(int userId, int taskId, int priority)` adds a task with the specified taskId and priority to the user with userId. It is guaranteed that taskId does not exist in the system.
- `void edit(int taskId, int newPriority)` updates the priority of the existing taskId to newPriority. It is guaranteed that taskId exists in the system.
- `void rmv(int taskId)` removes the task identified by taskId from the system. It is guaranteed that taskId exists in the system.
- `int execTop()` executes the task with the highest priority across all users. If there are multiple tasks with the same highest priority, execute the one with the highest taskId. After executing, the taskId is removed from the system. Return the userId associated with the executed task. If no tasks are available, return -1.

Note that a user may be assigned multiple tasks.

Example 1:
Input:
["TaskManager", "add", "edit", "execTop", "rmv", "add", "execTop"]
[[[[1, 101, 10], [2, 102, 20], [3, 103, 15]]], [4, 104, 5], [102, 8], [], [101], [5, 105, 15], []]

Output:
[null, null, null, 3, null, null, 5]

Explanation
- `TaskManager taskManager = new TaskManager([[1, 101, 10], [2, 102, 20], [3, 103, 15]]);` // Initializes with three tasks for Users 1, 2, and 3.
- `taskManager.add(4, 104, 5);` // Adds task 104 with priority 5 for User 4.
- `taskManager.edit(102, 8);` // Updates priority of task 102 to 8.
- `taskManager.execTop();` // return 3. Executes task 103 for User 3.
- `taskManager.rmv(101);` // Removes task 101 from the system.
- `taskManager.add(5, 105, 15);` // Adds task 105 with priority 15 for User 5.
- `taskManager.execTop();` // return 5. Executes task 105 for User 5.
 

Constraints:
- 1 <= tasks.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= userId <= 10^5
- 0 <= taskId <= 10^5
- 0 <= priority <= 10^9
- 0 <= newPriority <= 10^9
At most 2 * 10^5 calls will be made in total to add, edit, rmv, and execTop methods.
The input is generated such that taskId will be valid.

# Solution Breakdown & Deepdive
Breakdown and deep dive of the provided TaskManager solution, focusing on the computer science concepts, algorithms, principles, practices, and patterns involved:

## 1. **Computer Science Concepts**
### a) **Data Structures**
- **Heap (Priority Queue):**  
  The solution uses a binary heap (via Python’s `heapq`) to efficiently retrieve and manage the "top" task by priority. This is a classic example of a max-heap but implemented as a min-heap with negated priorities.
- **Hash Map (Dictionary):**  
  A dictionary is used to quickly map `taskId` to its associated `userId` and `priority`, allowing O(1) access for task management.

### b) **Lazy Deletion**
- Instead of removing or updating tasks directly in the heap (which would be O(n)), the solution simply marks tasks as removed/updated in the hash map. Invalid heap entries are ignored during `execTop`, a technique called **lazy deletion**.

---

## 2. **Algorithms**

### a) **Heap Operations**
- **Insert:**  
  Adding a task is O(log n) due to the heap property.
- **Remove/Update:**  
  Instead of removing from the heap directly (which would require a linear search), removals and updates are done in the hash map, and the heap is left with "stale" entries that are later skipped.
- **Pop Top:**  
  Repeatedly pops the heap’s top until a valid entry is found.

### b) **Tie-breaking**
- By pushing `(-priority, -taskId, taskId)` into the heap, the solution ensures:
  - Highest priority comes first (because of the negative sign).
  - For ties, highest taskId wins (again, negative sign ensures max-heap behavior).

---

## 3. **Principles & Practices**

### a) **Separation of Concerns**
- The heap is only responsible for ordering tasks.
- The hash map is responsible for tracking the current state of each task.
- This separation simplifies logic and improves maintainability.

### b) **Efficiency (Time Complexity)**
- All major operations are O(log n), except for accessing the hash map which is O(1).
- This is crucial given the constraints (`10^5`–`2*10^5` operations).

### c) **Correctness & Robustness**
- The solution guarantees that `execTop` always executes the correct task, even after arbitrary modifications/deletions, by checking validity at pop-time.

---

## 4. **Patterns**

### a) **Heap with Indirect Updates**
- Since binary heaps do not support efficient arbitrary removal or update, the “mark and skip” approach is used. This is a common pattern in competitive programming and large-scale systems.

### b) **Compound Key for Ordering**
- Using a tuple `(-priority, -taskId, taskId)` as the heap key is a well-established pattern for multi-level sorting in priority queues.

---

## 5. **Best Practices**

- **Avoiding Heap Pollution:**  
  Old/invalid entries are left in the heap but ignored during pop. This avoids the cost of heap rebalancing for every update/removal.
- **Consistent Interface:**  
  All operations—add, edit, remove, execute—are supported in O(log n) or O(1).
- **Guarantees on TaskId:**  
  The implementation leverages the guarantee that taskIds are unique and operations are always valid.

---

## 6. **Potential Improvements**

- **Heap Compaction:**  
  If many tasks are removed/edited, the heap could fill with dead entries. A periodic heap rebuild (compaction) could be added if performance degrades.
- **Custom Heap Implementations:**  
  For even more advanced requirements, one might use an indexed heap or a pairing heap for direct updates/removals.

---

## 7. **Related Patterns in Real Systems**

- **Job Schedulers:**  
  Similar approaches are used in job/task schedulers in distributed systems (like Kubernetes, Hadoop YARN, etc.).
- **Event Queues:**  
  Event-driven systems often use priority queues with lazy deletion for efficient task/event management.

## 8. **Summary Table**

| Operation      | Data Structure             | Time Complexity |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Add Task       | Heap + Hash Map           | O(log n)        |
| Edit Task      | Heap (mark) + Hash Map    | O(log n)        |
| Remove Task    | Hash Map (mark)           | O(1)            |
| Execute Top    | Heap (pop until valid)    | O(log n) (amortized) |
