## Section 2: Choosing Data Structures for Performance

Selecting the right data structures is the linchpin of efficient router design. In the context of our Python router, three primary operations drive our choices: maintaining FIFO (First-In, First-Out) order, enabling lightning-fast duplicate detection, and supporting rapid range queries for statistics. Let's break down why each data structure was chosen and how it contributes to the router's speed and reliability.

The `deque` from Python’s `collections` module forms the backbone of our packet buffer. Unlike a standard list, a `deque` (double-ended queue) allows for O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations from either end. This is crucial for a router, where packets must be appended as they arrive and the oldest must be evicted or forwarded with minimal delay. Relying on `deque` not only conserves memory but also ensures your router can handle high-throughput scenarios without bottlenecks. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a staple for queue-based systems.

To prevent duplicate packets, we utilize a `set` to store the unique key for each packet—a tuple of `(source, destination, timestamp)`. Python sets provide O(1) average-case performance for lookups, insertions, and deletions, making them perfect for fast duplicate checks. This means that as each packet arrives, the router can instantly determine if it’s already in memory, ensuring the integrity of the data stream. The set’s efficiency becomes even more apparent as the number of packets grows, eliminating the need for costly linear scans.

Another performance-critical aspect is efficiently answering range count queries: “How many packets with destination X have timestamps in [Y, Z]?” For this, we use a `defaultdict(list)`, mapping each destination to a sorted list of timestamps. Keeping these lists sorted allows us to leverage the `bisect` module, which implements binary search for fast insertion and querying. Inserting a new packet’s timestamp is O(log n) (using `bisect.insort`), and counting packets in a range is also O(log n) (with `bisect_left` and `bisect_right`). This is especially important for routers handling tens of thousands of packets, as naive approaches would be too slow.

This thoughtful combination of data structures—`deque` for FIFO, `set` for uniqueness, and `defaultdict` plus `bisect` for sorted range queries—achieves a harmonious balance. The router can scale to large memory limits, respond in real-time, and handle complex queries without sacrificing maintainability or readability. When designing such systems, always analyze your use cases and select data structures that minimize the time complexity for your critical operations. This not only improves performance but also makes your codebase easier to reason about and extend in the future.
