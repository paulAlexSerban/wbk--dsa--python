    "- `__new__` since a metaclass is a class that cerates other classes, `__new__` in metaclass is responsible for creating and returning a new class object.\n",
    "- `__init__` this method is responsible for initializing the new class object created by the metaclass, such as setting class attributes or other class-level properties\n",
    "- `__call__` in a metaclass, this method allows instances of the metaclass (where are class objects themselves) to be called as if they were functions - thi is executed when creating instances of the classes created by the metaclass - by customizing the method, you can contrl how instances of those are created or returned"
