    "Notes:\n",
    "- Python does not really have a constructor, but it does have a creation and initialization routines for classes\n",
    "- It does not strictly have a static keyword for variables, but it does support class-level variables and methods which for all purposes are static\n",
    "- `__new__` - is static method that is responsible for creating and returning a new instance of a class - it is the first step in the object instantiation process - it is typically overridden when you need to control the object creation process\n",
    "- `__init__` - is the instance method that initializes the instance after it has been created by `__new__` - it is typically overridden to set up the initial state of the object\n",
    "    - the `__init__` method does not return a value and it is called automatically after the object os created - this method is typically overridden to define custom attribute initialization\n",
    "- `__call__` is an instance method that allows a class instances to be called if they were functions"
