- revolves around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods and functions)
- common object oriented programming languages include Java, C++, Python, and Ruby
- based on the object-oriented programming paradigm, which is a programming paradigm that uses objects to design applications and computer programs
- based on the object-oriented design (OOD), object-oriented analysis (OOA) and object-oriented modeling (OOM) principles, which are a set of principles that guide the design of object-oriented systems
- based on the SOLID principles, which are a set of principles that help design object-oriented systems that are easy to maintain and extend
- based on the design patterns, which are reusable solutions to common problems in software design
