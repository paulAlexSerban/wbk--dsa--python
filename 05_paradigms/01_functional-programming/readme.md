# Functional Programming (FP)
- treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- it empathizes the use of immutable data and declarative expressions
- it is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements
- languages like Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, and Clojure are functional programming languages and some features in languages like Python, JavaScript, Java and Scala support functional programming
- functional programming is based on lambda calculus, which is a mathematical system for function definition, function application and recursion
