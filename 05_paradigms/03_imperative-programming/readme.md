# Imperative Programming
- describes a sequence of steps that change the program;s state
- languages like C, C++, Java, and Python are imperative programming languages
- based on the Von Neumann architecture, which is a computer architecture that stores program instructions and data in the same memory
- based on the Turing machine, which is a mathematical model of computation that defines a machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules
- based on the procedural programming paradigm, which is a programming paradigm that uses procedures, or routines, to perform computations
