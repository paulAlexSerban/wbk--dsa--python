# Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

## What is Top K?

The term "top k" refers to selecting the k most important, frequent, or relevant items from a collection. In this context, it means finding the k numbers in the list nums that appear most frequently.

Example of "Top k"
If you have a list of numbers:
`nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
And you want the top 2 most frequent numbers (k = 2), the result would be:
`[1, 2]`

- 1 appears 3 times.
- 2 appears 2 times.
- 3 appears 1 time. The top 2 most frequent numbers are 1 and 2.

Why Use "Top k"?
The concept of "top k" is common in many areas, such as:

- Search engines: Returning the top k most relevant results.
- Data analysis: Finding the top k most common items in a dataset.
- Machine learning: Selecting the top k features or predictions.

In this code, the top k frequent elements are determined using a min-heap to efficiently keep track of the k most frequent numbers.

## Practical Applications

1. **Data Analysis**: Identifying the most frequent elements in datasets can help in understanding
   trends and patterns, such as customer preferences or product popularity.
2. **Search Optimization**: Enhancing search algorithms by focusing on the most relevant or frequently
   searched items, improving user experience in applications like e-commerce or content platforms.
3. **Recommendation Systems**: Utilizing frequency data to recommend popular items or content to users,
   thereby increasing engagement and satisfaction.
4. **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzing text data to find the most common words or phrases,
   which can aid in sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and other NLP tasks.
5. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitoring network data to identify the most frequently accessed resources,
   helping in optimizing bandwidth usage and improving performance.
