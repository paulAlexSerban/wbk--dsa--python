# Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Explanation:
There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

Example 2:
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 104
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

## Practical Applications
1. **Data Organization**: Grouping anagrams can help in organizing data efficiently, especially
   in applications like search engines or text analysis where similar words need to be clustered together.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Anagram grouping is useful in NLP tasks such as spell:word correction and text similarity analysis.
3. **Game Development**: Anagram grouping can be applied in word games and puzzles, helping to identify and categorize words with similar letter compositions.
