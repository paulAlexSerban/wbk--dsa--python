# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.
###############
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
###############
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]
###############
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
# Output: [0,1]
###############
# Constraints:
# 2 <= nums.length <= 104
# -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
# -109 <= target <= 109
# Only one valid answer exists.
###############
# Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?
###############
# Solution:
# 1. Importing the List type from the typing module
# 2. Initialize a dictionary to store the number and its corresponding index
# 3. Iterate through the list of numbers along with their indices
# 4. Calculate the difference needed to reach the target from the current number
# 5. Check if the calculated difference is already present in the dictionary
# 6.1. If the difference is found, return the indices of the two numbers
# 6.2. The index of the current number and the index of the number that forms the required sum with the current number
# 7. If the difference is not found, store the current number and its index in the dictionary for future reference
# 8. Return an empty list if no such pair is found that adds up to the target
