# Encode and Decode Strings

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

```python
def encode(strs):
    # ... your code
    return encoded_string
```

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

```python
def decode(s):
    # ... your code
    return strs
```

So Machine 1 does:

```python
encoded_string = encode(strs)
```

where `strs` is a list of strings, and `encoded_string` is a single string that represents the encoded version of `strs`.

Then, the encoded string is sent to Machine 2, which decodes it back to the original list of strings:

```python
strs2 = decode(encoded_string)
```

where `strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the encode and decode methods.
You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as eval).

Example 1:
Input: dummy_input = ["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello","World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2
Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);

Example 2:
Input: dummy_input = [""]
Output: [""]

Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 200
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
- strs[i] contains any possible characters out of 256 valid ASCII characters.

# Practical Applications

1. **Data Serialization**: Encoding and decoding strings is essential in data serialization, where complex data structures need to be converted into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and later reconstructed.
2. **Network Communication**: In network protocols, encoding and decoding messages is crucial for ensuring that data is transmitted correctly between machines with potentially different architectures or data representations.
3. **Database Storage**: When storing strings in databases, encoding can help compress data and ensure that it is stored in a consistent format, making retrieval and manipulation more efficient.
4. **File Compression**: Encoding techniques are often used in file compression algorithms to reduce the size of files for storage or transmission, allowing for more efficient use of bandwidth and storage space.
5. **Security**: Encoding strings can be used to obfuscate sensitive data, making it less accessible to unauthorized users.
